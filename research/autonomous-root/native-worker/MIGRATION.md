# Native agent parity and .NET retirement plan

Status: proposed implementation and acceptance plan, 2026-10-14. Reviewed baseline:
`f3f911e`, including runtime changes `43ec7bc` and `f9e6d0c`. The installed .NET
worker remains the deployed fallback. This plan does not authorize a deployment,
reboot, change to device configuration, or removal of the fallback.

## Decision and scope

Continue from the existing native worker and launcher. Keep the JavaScript HTTPS
service, enrolled Python client and shared setup engine; rewriting those would
increase migration scope without removing a .NET dependency. Complete public
behavior parity before selecting native as the default. Retire the managed worker
first, then remove managed acquisition and recovery dependencies, and only then
remove managed artifacts from the current agent distribution.

There are two separately reportable milestones:

1. **Native worker default:** commands, transfers, jobs and helper management run
   natively. Acquisition or recovery may still invoke a managed component. This
   milestone is not a .NET-free agent.
2. **Agent .NET sunset:** installation, acquisition, ordinary operation, reconnect,
   maintenance, upgrade and recovery no longer require project-owned managed code
   on either supported TV. Normal agent builds no longer need a .NET SDK.

Do not remove the TV manufacturer's .NET installation. Other Couchroot components
such as telemetry, saver and setup utilities need their own dependency inventory;
agent sunset is not a claim that the entire repository or TV is .NET-free. Any
managed setup utility required by the agent's supported fresh-install or recovery
path belongs in this migration, even if it lives outside `autonomous-root`.

## Review of Opus's work

The cleanup is useful and should be retained. The source replaces fixed guardian
polling with signal-aware `ppoll`, uses an eventfd to notify the job monitor, and
waits for foreground output or deadlines. Shared functions consolidate job-slot
release, record reads, directory scans, signal-masked thread starts and wait-status
handling. Descriptor admission now covers protocol allocation paths and reserves
one descriptor for the job monitor. The source still identifies itself as a
prototype and is not wired into the production builder or service launcher.

The recorded before/after device measurements show foreground cost per spawned
process falling from 40.9 to 3.4 ms on QN90A and 40.8 to 3.1 ms on S90D. Idle
guardian context switches fell from approximately 100/s to 10/s. These are
microbenchmark observations, not complete startup or end-to-end speedup claims.
The event-wait revision passed the extended suite on both TVs. The admission
revision subsequently passed one-hour endurance and 76 distinct extended checks
on each TV. See [cleanup results](cleanup-results.json) and
[admission results](admission-results.json).

Evidence qualifications that must survive the migration:

- S90D's first endurance attempt was interrupted by power-off/deep suspend. Its
  later successful rerun does not establish standby or resume parity.
- Kernel ring buffers retained only the final several minutes. Absence of errors
  in those tails does not establish absence throughout the hour.
- An earlier S90D recovery took 2,188 ms against a 2,000 ms gate. Later stopped-worker
  results of 1,069 ms and 1,031 ms do not explain that tail. Keep the threshold and
  investigate it under continuous observation.
- Descriptor admission is not a reservation against external limit changes and
  does not qualify guardian exhaustion or system-wide `ENFILE`.
- Tests commonly use the separately compiled fault-test worker. The final ordinary
  production executable needs its own smoke, parity and endurance qualification.

Local revalidation for this review passed all 49 native ASAN/UBSAN tests. The
repository runner discovered 275 tests: 226 passed and 49 native tests were
skipped there because they ran separately. No TV was contacted during this review.
This is a focused source and migration-readiness review, not an exhaustive audit
of every native code path.

This review inspected source changes and recorded evidence; it does not establish
why Opus paused. No motive should be inferred from the absence of an acquisition port.

## Dependency inventory

| Component | Current responsibility | Migration disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `payload/SamsungTvRootAgent.cs`, `AgentOperations.cs`, `AgentJobs.cs`, `AgentHelpers.cs`, `AgentLauncher.cs` | Managed protocol worker, operations and launcher embedding | Replace with native worker after parity gates; retain managed artifacts during rollback window |
| `payload/SamsungTvArchiveRoot.cs` | Firmware-specific acquisition stage invoked by the service | Separate native acquisition adapter workstream; preserve existing supported behavior and profile restrictions |
| `recovery/Program.cs` | Maintenance setting readback, conditional restoration and delayed recovery | Native utility with equivalent validation, timing, drift refusal and result semantics |
| `service/agent.js` | Acquires workers, stages payloads, owns connection generations, readiness, retry budgets and cleanup | Retain JavaScript; introduce explicit implementation selection and manifests |
| `service/main.js`, `api.js`, `policy.js`, `vendor/root-agent.js` | HTTPS lifecycle, enrollment, request journal, operation routing and wire protocol | Retain; test with each worker through the real service |
| `tvsetup/autonomous_root.py`, artifact builder and launcher builder | Per-profile build, packaging, manifests and verification | Add native artifacts and reproducibility checks; remove managed build only at sunset |
| `tvsetup/root.py`, `transport.py`, `operations.py`, trial/recovery callers | Setup access, firmware/runtime guards, controls and maintenance orchestration | Trace the agent's actual call graph; replace any required managed control/bootstrap path before claiming fresh-install independence |
| `scripts/build-native.py`, `check-root-launcher.py`, `check-dependencies.py`, managed harness | Build and validation dependencies | Split agent-only checks from unrelated projects; replace managed oracle with retained fixtures at sunset |
| `native-launcher/app-launcher.c` | App identity, labels, environment and descriptor cleanup | Reuse as an independently versioned, manifest-bound native artifact |

`tvsetup/native_bootstrap.py` and `native_trial.py` concern a telemetry collector
pilot. Their existence does not establish native root-agent acquisition or production
integration. Reuse applicable journal/rollback patterns, not their qualification claims.

## Feature parity matrix

The public contract is [CAPABILITIES.md](../CAPABILITIES.md), enforced jointly by
the HTTPS service, client and managed worker. Preserve observable fields, limits,
error classification and side effects. Additional native diagnostics may be additive.

| Area | Current native coverage | Required closure before default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Connection and frames | Existing authenticated sequence protocol, EXEC, OP, OPDATA and OPWRITE | Real service conformance: malformed/truncated frames, replay refusal, connection loss, partial bodies and shutdown; no automatic operation replay |
| HTTPS and enrollment | Supplied by unchanged JavaScript service | Native through real enrolled client: request IDs, request journal, certificate continuity, keep-alive, connection limits and serialized mutations |
| Readiness and identity | Boot, uptime, worker and guardian diagnostics | Production capability names; launcher implementation/digest shape; readiness only after validated worker status and required capabilities; acquisition timestamp and stale-generation behavior |
| Root foreground execution | Output, exit code, timeout, truncation and process cleanup | Compare byte output, nonzero exit, empty output, quoting, Unicode, invalid UTF-8, embedded NUL rejection, exact size limits and timeout boundaries through service |
| App execution | Independent native launcher and profile; 100–25,000 ms timeout | Preserve UID/EUID/GID, groups, label, working directory, environment, descriptor inheritance and result conversion; specify invalid UTF-8 replacement behavior |
| Transfers | Eight transfers, 2 GiB files, 1 MiB chunks, ranges, SHA-256, JSON/binary chunks, conditional commit | Expand beyond direct children of one experiment directory; full public read/write path policy and parent traversal; resume metadata and error parity |
| Transfer publication | Create-only link and digest-conditioned rename | Preserve 0600 publication, no unsolicited parent creation, partial-write offset reporting, worker-lifetime IDs and no blind retries; exercise concurrent external writers and document existing limits |
| Jobs | Sixteen retained jobs, 64 records, 1 MiB stream rings, 64 KiB tails, 100 ms–24 h timeouts | Production storage root, legacy record handling, exact state/nullable-exit/output semantics and same-boot/reboot interpretation |
| Cancellation | Current owned jobs and descendants supervised | Resolve explicit difference: managed code permits some saved-process cancellation; native refuses it. Do not silently advertise exact parity |
| Helpers | Digest-checked copy, app execution view, bounded active views and owned cleanup | Production source roots, retained-directory limits, returned metadata and old-helper cleanup policy; no assumption that IDs survive a worker switch |
| Launcher | Independent staging, digest checks and lifecycle recovery | Bind source and digest to package manifest; production readiness; interrupted update and old-version handling |
| Worker lifetime | Bounded experiment default; explicit `--production` removes worker/guardian expiry and separates idle from frame deadlines (local validation only) | Production lifetime separate from request/job deadlines; long-running idle sessions and 24-hour jobs without lifetime expiry |
| Crash recovery | Guardian, progress watchdog, ownership journals and same-boot reconciliation | Production start/stop/reacquisition integration, interrupted upgrade, prior-version journals, standby/resume and cross-boot qualification |
| Command signals | Core-producing signals intercepted, actual termination reported separately | Approve/document changed behavior or implement compatibility mode; managed command signal handlers may behave differently |
| Resource pressure | Protocol descriptor admission; bounded logs and counts | Guardian/startup descriptor budget, concurrent pressure, memory allocation failure, disk full/read-only, process exhaustion and large-file storage stalls |
| Acquisition and maintenance recovery | Borrowed from managed deployment | Native implementation and independent acceptance on each supported firmware; no hidden managed prerequisite |
| Diagnostics | Native status and fault ring | Service-readable bounded start/stop/failure status, selected implementation/version, fallback reason and actionable recovery state; replace managed status-file assumptions |
| Legacy READFILE/WRITEFILE | Omitted | Current public service/client do not expose them. Keep outside the replacement contract unless consumer inventory finds a supported user |

## Ordered implementation work

Phase-one implementation status is recorded in [PARITY.md](PARITY.md): the
contract and differential harness, opt-in production file access and offline
retained-job import/export are implemented. Live state installation and worker
selection are still gated on the later packaging/rollback work below. Local follow-ups
add explicit production lifetime and request-side storage progress. Service and bundled-client response budgets now distinguish storage operations
from ordinary operations, with local HTTPS/wire qualification using a scripted
peer. Native through the real service, device deployment and measured storage
limits remain unqualified; see `PARITY.md`.

### 1 Freeze the compatibility contract

Create a machine-readable operation/result matrix and differential tests that run
identical requests against managed and native workers. Normalize only generated
IDs, timestamps, process identities and explicitly additive fields. Compare known
failure versus unknown transport outcome, emitted bytes, filesystem side effects
and retained job state, not just exit zero. Include native through the existing
JavaScript service; a standalone controller is insufficient.

Record each intentional difference as a versioned contract decision: command
signals, saved-job cancellation, stronger descendant cleanup, malformed-input
handling, UTF-8 conversion and added status fields. Recommended saved-job policy:
refuse cancellation when ownership is no longer provable and expose that limitation
explicitly. Never recreate saved-PID signaling merely to satisfy a superficial test.

Deliverable: compatibility tests and an approved difference ledger. Gate: every
public operation has success, rejection, interrupted-response and boundary cases.

### 2 Complete paths, retained state and long-running behavior

Replace the single-directory transfer resolver with explicit production read and
write policies. Use component-based traversal suitable for these older kernels;
preserve refusal of symlink components and special-device files. Do not require
new kernel-only APIs without a supported fallback. Recalculate peak descriptor
use after introducing parent directory handles and test exactly at each threshold.

Move job storage from experiment `.jobs` to a versioned production layout. Import
or expose managed `/opt/couchroot-agent/jobs` records without replay. Keep completed
results, preserve ambiguous outcomes, and define behavior for malformed records,
partial `.next` files, duplicate IDs and capacity shared with legacy records.
Do not fabricate a native owner identity for an old managed record.

Use copy-and-verify migration or a read-only legacy view with an atomic manifest
commit. Keep legacy bytes unchanged until the rollback window closes. Test rollback
with native-created records: the managed worker must not misread them or reuse an
ID. Shared writers are prohibited; selection must establish a single owner.

Remove experiment alarms from the production mode while retaining bounded requests,
job deadlines, drain deadlines and watchdogs. A test-only bounded mode remains
available. Audit progress reporting through hashing, copying and durable writes:
a valid large operation must not look like a 30-second deadlock. Test sparse/large
files, slow storage, long idle connections and 24-hour jobs separately.

Deliverable: production-mode worker with public path/state behavior. Gate: full
contract suite and native host tests pass, including downgrade and interrupted
migration fixtures.

### 3 Integrate packaging and service selection

Local packaging foundation is implemented: `--native-candidate` includes two
reproducibly built ordinary artifacts and a manifest while retaining managed
selection. See `PARITY.md` for build evidence. Durable native selection, manifest
validation at service startup, state installation/rollback and real-device
candidate acceptance are still required; this is not phase-three completion.

Package ordinary worker, guardian functionality and app launcher from reproducible
source builds. Do not ship fault-control operations or depend on a copied binary
from a prior experiment. Record per-artifact hashes, ABI, dependencies and profile
compatibility in the manifest. Verify dynamic library availability on both TVs.

Retain the existing service and enrollment data. Add an explicit, durable selection
of managed or native, selected version and last-known-good version. Stage and verify
new artifacts before changing selection. Replace hard-coded managed launch arguments,
file allowlists, status-file assumptions and payload manifests in `service/agent.js`.
Require the expected implementation and capabilities during readiness, not merely
boot ID and a numeric uptime.

Preserve connection-generation checks, capped acquisition retries and backoff.
On worker failure, reconcile its jobs and owned resources before selecting another
implementation. A fallback may restore availability; it must never replay the last
command, job start, upload chunk or commit. Preserve unknown outcomes in the journal.

Deliverable: opt-in native selection with managed default and tested rollback.
Gate: packaged native works through the unchanged client in a temporary trial;
managed rollback works with retained data and interrupted requests.

### 4 Replace acquisition and maintenance dependencies

Treat acquisition as a separate component with a narrow contract: validate the
supported profile, establish the required process identity and isolated execution
context, hand off the selected worker, report readiness/failure and clean only its
owned temporary resources. Port the existing supported behavior rather than adding
new device coverage or changing the method during the worker migration.

Inventory the complete managed call chain, including fresh installation and access
recovery. Replace `SamsungTvArchiveRoot` and any required managed bootstrap/control
utility with individually testable native components. Preserve profile checks,
one-launch behavior, retry bounds, result reporting and cleanup. A native worker
started by a managed bootstrap is only milestone one.

Replace the maintenance recovery utility's readback, conditional restore and delayed
restore behavior. Test invalid inputs, setting drift, already-restored state,
interrupted execution and failed readback using local fixtures before device trials.
The recovery path must remain usable when the selected worker fails before readiness.

Deliverable: native acquisition/recovery artifacts and agent-only build path.
Gate: each supported TV can start and reacquire native without a managed agent
process; required installation and recovery paths also demonstrate independence.
Actual device-setting changes require a separately authorized, journaled trial.

### 5 Qualify the integrated native agent

Use the exact ordinary packaged build on both TVs, first sequentially, while keeping
the managed fallback available. Record source revision and artifact hashes. Capture
kernel and lifecycle evidence continuously into bounded private logs, with explicit
coverage gaps and clock handling across suspend. A final ring-buffer tail is not
full-run evidence.

| Test group | Required observations |
| --- | --- |
| Public operations | Complete differential suite through HTTPS, app identity/environment, helper stage/execute/release, large transfers and conditional commit |
| Jobs and state | Concurrent quiet/noisy jobs, retention/cursors, cancel/timeout, 24-hour job, persisted outcome, migration and rollback without replay |
| Lifecycle | Graceful stop, worker loss, guardian loss, stalled main/monitor, service loss, reconnect, install interrupted before/after selection, interrupted cleanup |
| Pressure | Descriptor thresholds, guardian budget, ENOSPC/read-only, allocation/process failures and slow storage; no unintended command execution |
| Endurance | Proposed gate: at least 24 hours per TV with mixed work and idle periods; stable descriptor/thread/mount counts and no unexplained sustained memory growth |
| Timing | Preserve the two-second recovery gate where it applies; collect phase timings and tail distributions, including the previously observed S90D outlier |
| Power lifecycle | Separately authorized standby/resume, deep suspend, software reboot, cold start and interrupted-write/power-loss cases; validate old-boot journals and readiness |
| Recovery | Native failure before readiness restores the last-known-good implementation without host-side reconstruction or a managed utility hidden in the native-only path |

No reboot or deliberate power transition is authorized by this plan. Prepare those
fixtures and mark them pending. Native default and sunset remain gated until the
required transitions are actually tested, or the user explicitly approves a narrower
support contract. An accidental interruption is useful evidence, not a planned test.

Repeat full process-tree measurements for managed and native: guardian plus worker
RSS/PSS/private memory/swap, CPU, idle wakeups, peak descriptors, acquisition-to-ready
time, app startup, job latency and transfer throughput. Alternate versions under
comparable conditions; retain sample counts, medians and tails. Distinguish complete
acquisition from a warm worker launch. Propose no blanket speedup target: require
no material regression in supported workflows and quantify the intended benefit.

### 6 Deprecate, switch default and sunset

Use release gates rather than a fixed calendar deadline:

| Release stage | Behavior | Exit criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Candidate | Managed default, explicit native trial | Contract/state/packaging gates and recovery rehearsal pass on both TVs |
| Native default | Native selected; verified managed package retained for rollback | Integrated acquisition and power-lifecycle qualification pass; no unresolved outcome-loss or duplicate-execution issue |
| Managed deprecated | Managed is maintenance-only; notices identify replacement and rollback policy | Proposed minimum 14 days of ordinary native use on each TV, including authorized lifecycle transitions; no unresolved fallback event; owner approves removal |
| Agent .NET sunset | Current package and agent build exclude managed worker/acquisition/recovery | Native-only fresh install, upgrade, reacquisition and recovery demonstrated on both profiles; zero required managed agent process in lifecycle observations |

The 24-hour qualification and 14-day observation periods are proposed minimums,
not already completed tests. A period with either TV unavailable does not count as
an equivalent amount of active observation. Record exceptions explicitly.

Before switching a device, quiesce mutations, inventory active jobs/transfers,
complete or explicitly cancel owned work, snapshot data, verify the rollback
package and recovery access, then commit selection. Never silently discard a
running job or treat an incomplete transfer as committed. Switch one TV first;
validate it before switching the other. A rollback uses the same journaled state
transition and preserves native-created outcomes for inspection.

At sunset remove managed agent artifacts from the package, current build graph and
runtime selection; update manifests, dependency checks, tests and documentation.
Retain the last supported managed release and its verified recovery material in
the private release archive for an explicitly documented retention period. Remove
only known project-owned stale device files after ownership checks. Leave vendor
runtime files and unrelated Couchroot components untouched. Historical source and
result records remain available; retirement does not require rewriting Git history.

## Work packages and dependencies

| Work package | Main files | Depends on | Completion evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Contract and intentional differences | `CAPABILITIES.md`, service/client tests, native and managed harnesses | Reviewed baseline | Differential matrix, accepted differences |
| Production paths and limits | Native `worker.c`, common helpers, transfer tests | Contract | Full path/size/race/descriptor threshold fixtures |
| Job migration and rollback | Native `jobs.h`, reconciliation, setup migration code | Contract | Legacy/native state import and downgrade tests |
| Lifetime and diagnostics | Native worker/guardian/progress, service status | Contract | Long-idle/long-job/slow-storage tests |
| Packaging and selection | `tvsetup/autonomous_root.py`, builders, `service/agent.js` | Contract, paths, state | Reproducible ordinary build and managed/native selection tests |
| Acquisition and maintenance ports | Acquisition payload, recovery utility, required setup callers | Dependency inventory | No managed process required for each lifecycle path |
| Integrated qualification | Acceptance harness, real service tests, private device runner | All above | Both-TV acceptance, continuous evidence and rollback rehearsal |
| Default and retirement | Release metadata, selection, build/dependency cleanup, docs | Qualification and observation window | Per-device approval and sunset checklist |

Start with the contract, path parity and retained-state work. Acquisition can be
specified independently, but default selection must wait for its acceptance. Avoid
another broad cleanup pass until these deliverables are complete.

## Definition of done

.NET is sunset for the agent only when all public features either match or have an
explicitly accepted versioned difference; retained outcomes survive upgrade and
rollback; both supported profiles pass integrated lifecycle acceptance; recovery
works without the managed components being retired; production artifacts contain
no test hooks; the agent-only build has no .NET SDK dependency; and the owner has
approved the final removal after the observation window. Keep .NET available until
then.
